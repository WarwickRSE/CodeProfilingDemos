This repo contains example code to demonstrate a range of
"realistic" scenarios for code profiles. We try and show
system calls (blocked in the kernel), long running functions,
much repeated functions etc. 

The idea is to give an introduction to reading profiles for
optimisation without needing to understand complicated code.
